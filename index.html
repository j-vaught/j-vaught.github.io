          <p style="font-family: Arial";>I love spending time doing HW for classes, and I usually do extra HW to get on Professors' good side. During some research for a HW Assignment, I fell into a "Rabbit-Hole", researching CEC statistics and I discovered an alarming trend here at UofSC. Check out the Engineering Enrollment statistics below.</p>

          <p style="font-family: Arial";>I have spent a few years honing my networking and leadership skills. Recently, I took up a position as Secretary of ASME, an Engineering club on campus, and I have been communicating with department heads, other companies, etc. I also plan to join Student Government. I decided to do this after noticing that the Engineering College had a few unfilled positions due to low interest from the college.</p>
